## How do I install these formulae?

Just `brew tap lukaspustina/os` and then `brew install <formula>`.

If the formula conflicts with one from Homebrew/homebrew or another tap, you can `brew install lukaspustina/os/<formula>`.

You can also install via URL:

```bash
brew install https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lukaspustina/homebrew-os/master/<formula>.rb
```
